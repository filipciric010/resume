```

Environment variables:

Copy `.env.example` and set required values. In dev, AI calls are proxied to the server, do not set OpenAI key on the client.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# fill in SUPABASE vars and optionally server OPENAI_API_KEY
```

## üß∞ Production Build & Deploy

```bash
npm run build             # builds client to dist/
npm start                 # runs server (serves dist/ and /api)
```

docker build -t ai-resume .
docker run -p 3001:3001 \
   -e CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3001 \
